What's with the outfit?	(1)
Been to a First Communion or what?	(2)
No, I came from the date	(3)
you didn't want to go on.	(4)
And how crazy was she?	(5)
Not crazy at all!	(6)
Andrea is very polite, very elegant.	(7)
Not just because I met her today,	(8)
but because I know who her family are.	(9)
Oh yeah? 	(10)
	(11)
How's that?	(12)
I've got something to confess.	(13)
A few days ago, I saw Samuel and Gabriela.	(14)
You do know who I mean, don't you?	(15)
That's Nico's mum's sister.	(16)
That's right, her.	(17)
Well, they were there talking	(18)
and saying that their mum	(19)
had just got divorced,	(20)
and that she'd like a new partner.	(21)
So the lady... what-	(22)
Andrea.	(23)
Andrea.	(24)
Andrea is Gabriela's mum.	(25)
Exactly.	(26)
So, it immediately occurred to me	(27)
that this lady, so beautiful,	(28)
so delicate and elegant,	(29)
is perfect for Don Nelson.	(30)
They thought the same,	(31)
so we started sending her messages…	(32)
What? What?	(33)
Yes, as you.	(34)
You used my identity	(35)
without my permission?	(36)
That's an abuse of my trust, Augustine!	(37)
And I, I could, I could report you.	(38)
No, wait, easy, easy.	(39)
Don't get like that. Relax.	(40)
I did it for your sake.	(41)
And now that I've met her in person,	(42)
I can be sure.	(43)
I can now say	(44)
she's the perfect woman for you.	(45)
Why are you so sure?	(46)
She's beautiful,	(47)
she's distinguished, she's elegant.	(48)
And besides that she's very sweet, she's kind and…	(49)
And, well,	(50)
she's not interested in money.	(51)
She's a romantic.	(52)
She loves the messages I send her.	(53)
We send her, to be more precise,	(54)
because you're using my name.	(55)
Yeah, right, we send her,	(56)
we send her.	(57)
So? Would you like to go out with her?	(58)
Well, how would we do it?	(59)
She thinks Nelson is you.	(60)
This morning I told her	(61)
I'm your assistant.	(62)
That you sent me to apologise because	(63)
you couldn't make it.	(64)
I bought her some flowers…	(65)
Oh, you owe me 250 pesos.	(66)
Hey, wait, wait.	(67)
That was your idea.	(68)
Yes, but you had to 	(69)
get her something.	(70)
I also told her to have some breakfast,	(71)
your treat.	(72)
I have to buy her breakfast too?	(73)
What were you thinking, Augustine?	(74)
No, wait, look.	(75)
To show you 	(76)
I'm with you on this,	(77)
the flowers are on me.	(78)
And she didn't want any breakfast.	(79)
I'm telling you, she's not a gold digger.	(80)
What do you say? Will you do it?	(81)
Well…	(82)
I'm curious.	(83)
And, I confess, I'm way out of practice	(84)
with things like this, so…	(85)
Where do I start?	(86)
Look, for now,	(87)
we'll send a message asking her out	(88)
and saying sorry for today.	(89)
Look, I'll write it to show you,	(90)
okay?	(91)
Distinguished, beautiful lady.	(92)
What do you think?	(93)
Sounds good.	(94)
I'll send it to you, okay?	(95)
Okay, perfect, yeah.	(96)
Can we talk?	(97)
Excuse me.	(98)
Yeah.	(99)
Have you eaten?	(100)
No, I was going to go to	(101)
La Fonda de Doña Carolina.	(102)
Shall we?	(103)
I haven't eaten either,	(104)
and, well, we could talk.	(105)
Let's go.	(106)
Anything else?	(107)
I don't like to see you so serious.	(108)
And I know	(109)
it's about the baby.	(110)
Honey, I already explained why	(111)
I don't want to have one.	(112)
I understand why you want to be a mother.	(113)
I'm sad not to be able to give you that,	(114)
but for me the time for that has passed.	(115)
What I want is to enjoy the time	(116)
I have left with you, my love.	(117)
Before you ever thought about	(118)
getting pregnant, we were great.	(119)
The idea didn't just come to me overnight.	(120)
I've always wanted to be a mother.	(121)
And because I love you	(122)
and we're finally together,	(123)
I thought I could make	(124)
that dream come true.	(125)
I know, but it's a dream that it's too late for.	(126)
Okay, I understand.	(127)
Excuse me.	(128)
What do you want to talk about?	(129)
Since we got married,	(130)
I know things haven't been good on my side.	(131)
I haven't treated you	(132)
the way you deserve,	(133)
and I've been doing a lot of thinking.	(134)
I want you to know that from now on,	(135)
my attitude is going to be different.	(136)
I want to dedicate myself to you	(137)
and the baby on the way.	(138)
I want to do everything I can	(139)
to make us into a real family.	(140)
Pedro, are you sure about	(141)
what you're saying?	(142)
Of course.	(143)
I don't want to get my hopes up for nothing.	(144)
It would be very difficult	(145)
to lose you again.	(146)
That's not going to happen, Gina.	(147)
Give me another chance, please.	(148)
Okay.	(149)
Look, all I want	(150)
is what's best for our baby.	(151)
Clean slate?	(152)
Clean slate.	(153)
Thank you.	(154)
What do you think, Doctor?	(155)
I've improved, haven't I?	(156)
Unfortunately not.	(157)
Don't say that.	(158)
You're practically the same	(159)
as the first time I saw you.	(160)
And that's a sign that you're not	(161)
doing what I told you to.	(162)
What can I say, Doctor?	(163)
I've given myself a few breaks.	(164)
It's not that easy to follow	(165)
such a strict diet straight off.	(166)
Besides, I've been under	(167)
a lot of pressure and…	(168)
And that counts for something, right?	(169)
Look, I get it.	(170)
But if you don't follow	(171)
my instructions to the letter,	(172)
you're at risk of dying.	(173)
Your condition requires a great deal	(174)
of care and discipline.	(175)
Okay, Doctor, I'll do my best.	(176)
And the psychologist?	(177)
Yes, I went once, but with so much work	(178)
I couldn't go again.	(179)
What you said to me before is	(180)
more than enough for me	(181)
to understand what's wrong.	(182)
This isn't a game.	(183)
Either you follow my instructions,	(184)
or you may have a serious crisis.	(185)
Keeping your diabetes	(186)
under control depends on you.	(187)
I can't do any more.	(188)
I want to see you in a month.	(189)
And I hope that, by then,	(190)
the results of your analysis	(191)
will be very different, okay?	(192)
Yes, Doctor.	(193)
Go and see the nutritionist.	(194)
Andrea answered me.	(195)
She says she'd love	(196)
to have dinner with you.	(197)
Where should I tell her you're taking her?	(198)
I don't know…	(199)
How about that sandwich place?	(200)
Oh, no, man. Incredible, as always.	(201)
What do you mean that sandwich place?	(202)
You'll scare her.	(203)
You have to take her to a nice restaurant.	(204)
If you like, on the first date,	(205)
invest, spend a little,	(206)
then bring the level down later on.	(207)
Let's see…	(208)
I know.	(209)
	(210)
How about Pierangelo?	(211)
What	(212)
Okay, okay.	(213)
	(214)
I'll message her.	(215)
Here it is.	(216)
Let's see. Andrea, here it is.	(217)
Your kind answer…	(218)
has made my heart race.	(219)
	(220)
Would you like to meet at Pierangelo	(221)
tomorrow at eight o'clock?	(222)
Perfect.	(223)
I love that restaurant.	(224)
I'll see you there.	(225)
She says perfect.	(226)
This is a done deal.	(227)
Why is it that if you write so well,	(228)
the woman you're crazy about	(229)
doesn't give you a chance?	(230)
Don't bring that up.	(231)
It's an impossible love.	(232)
Now, where were we?	(233)
You have to say nice things to Andrea.	(234)
Tell her things that come to you,	(235)
open your soul up to her.	(236)
Imagine I'm her	(237)
and we're in a restaurant.	(238)
What would you say?	(239)
That's very difficult.	(240)
Why?	(241)
Because you're ugly with a capital U.	(242)
I'm not ugly,	(243)
I'm just not at my best.	(244)
You just focus on your thing.	(245)
Okay!	(246)
Perhaps don't look at me.	(247)
Yeah, that	(248)
	(249)
What would you say to her?	(250)
Andrea, you have really pretty eyes.	(251)
Are they yours?	(252)
No. We're screwed, aren't we?	(253)
Let's see, close your eyes.	(254)
Here, take a deep breath.	(255)
There, imagine you're with Andrea.	(256)
Let's see.	(257)
Watching the sun go down on the beach.	(258)
The rays that hide behind the horizon	(259)
bounce off her blond hair.	(260)
Andrea,	(261)
I feel like I'm drowning in the depths of you.	(262)
Hi.	(263)
Come in.	(264)
Thank you.	(265)
I'm here to apologize.	(266)
I wasn't very nice to you this morning.	(267)
Don't worry, I was just going to say hi	(268)
and bring you some sweet bread.	(269)
But come on in, don't just stand there.	(270)
You want a cup of coffee? A cup of tea?	(271)
No, thank you. Thank you very much.	(272)
You talked to Pedro, didn't you?	(273)
Yes, why?	(274)
Thanks to what you told him,	(275)
Pedro decided to change his attitude.	(276)
He's willing to do everything for us	(277)
so we can build a family as God intended.	(278)
That's nice.	(279)
You don't know how happy I am.	(280)
Pedro means everything to me.	(281)
He promised that he wouldn't think	(282)
about anything other than us,	(283)
my baby and me.	(284)
Uhhuh.	(285)
I hope that means	(286)
he's forgotten about Elena.	(287)
Ever since she came into his life,	(288)
he's done nothing but suffer,	(289)
don't you think?	(290)
You have nothing else to say?	(291)
What do you want me to say?	(292)
I'm sorry,	(293)
but I don't know what you want to hear.	(294)
At least tell me you're happy for us.	(295)
No, of course I'm happy for you.	(296)
Can I get you a cup of coffee or tea?	(297)
No, I'm really fine, thanks.	(298)
I just wanted to stop by.	(299)
I'll let you get to	(300)
everything you have to do.	(301)
Take care	(302)
Thank you.	(303)
You too.	(304)
Pedro... Pedro's never going to be happy	(305)
with that woman,	(306)
no matter how hard he tries.	(307)
And? Aren't you going to eat lunch?	(308)
I ate early with Gina.	(309)
Aren't you going out?	(310)
No, I brought my own lunch.	(311)
Yes.	(312)
Are you going to try the car tomorrow?	(313)
I have to.	(314)
I'd love to go with you.	(315)
With the adjustments you made,	(316)
it must be powerful, right?	(317)
Ask Nelson to give you a chance.	(318)
I don't mind, really.	(319)
No, no way.	(320)
I've got tons of work.	(321)
I might even stay late today to get ahead.	(322)
I'm going to go eat my tacos.	(323)
Enjoy.	(324)
Hey, how'd it go with the doctor?	(325)
Huh?	(326)
What did Doctor Araiza tell you?	(327)
Right, the doctor.	(328)
What's wrong?	(329)
You're busy, right?	(330)
No.	(331)
Well, yes.	(332)
I'm working on a car	(333)
and I don't know what's wrong with it.	(334)
Just tell me how it went	(335)
and I'll leave you alone.	(336)
Good.	(337)
Great, better than I expected. Yes.	(338)
That's great.	(339)
You don't know how happy that makes me.	(340)
I'll let you go.	(341)
Keep working on your car, okay?	(342)
Okay.	(343)
What's going on?	(344)
I can't get the car up on the ramp.	(345)
It's making a weird noise.	(346)
That's why I worked with the towers.	(347)
I'll call the technician tomorrow.	(348)
Yes.	(349)
What time are you going to try the car?	(350)
Well, as soon as he gets here.	(351)
Well, let's go, then.	(352)
Jimmy, lock things up when you leave.	(353)
Yes, boss. Don't worry.	(354)
Thank you.	(355)
See you tomorrow.	(356)
Have a good one.	(357)
Okay, get some rest.	(358)
Thanks, you too.	(359)
Good night, Ma.	(360)
Good night, son.	(361)
I made<i> sincronizadas. </i>Are you hungry?	(362)
Yes, actually, I am.	(363)
Sit down.	(364)
Where's my dad?	(365)
He's not home yet.	(366)
I talked to him this afternoon, he told me	(367)
he was having a problem with a car.	(368)
Son, I want to talk to you about Pedro.	(369)
What about him?	(370)
Well, he told me that Ernesto told him	(371)
that if he didn't marry Gina,	(372)
Elena would never see Nico again.	(373)
And he also told me that	(374)
the only one who knew about it was you.	(375)
Why didn't you say something?	(376)
We could have done something.	(377)
There was nothing to do, Ma.	(378)
Ernesto had it all figured out,	(379)
and if Pedro hadn't married Gina,	(380)
Elena would've lost her son.	(381)
I didn't say anything	(382)
because Pedro asked me not to.	(383)
Some secrets are more harmful	(384)
if you keep them than if you tell them.	(385)
Are you thinking about telling Elena?	(386)
I don't know, son.	(387)
At this point,	(388)
her finding out wouldn't fix anything.	(389)
It'll just destroy Gina's life.	(390)
You know she's not my cup of tea,	(391)
but, well, I don't want to hurt her either.	(392)
Hey, do you think Gina knows about all this?	(393)
Listen, why would she agree to marry Pedro	(394)
so suddenly when she knows that he loves Elena?	(395)
That would mean	(396)
that Gina and Ernesto are colluding.	(397)
And I don't even know	(398)
if they know each other, Ma.	(399)
You've gone way too far now.	(400)
Something tells me I'm not so wrong.	(401)
Something like what?	(402)
I don't know, my intuition.	(403)
That too bad, Ma,	(404)
because that doesn't prove anything.	(405)
Honey,	(406)
I've been thinking a lot	(407)
about what we talked about.	(408)
It hurts me.	(409)
It really hurts me to see you so sad.	(410)
That's how I feel.	(411)
I'd really like to fix things.	(412)
I've thought about our situation	(413)
a thousand times over.	(414)
And I want to find a solution.	(415)
Did you find one?	(416)
I think so, but...	(417)
The truth is,	(418)
I have to make a huge sacrifice.	(419)
But I don't see any other solution.	(420)
Your dream of being a mom	(421)
is what matters now, right?	(422)
I have no doubt you'll be a wonderful mom.	(423)
I can see you giving	(424)
all your love to that child.	(425)
That's why I have to put aside	(426)
my selfishness and think only of you.	(427)
Are you saying	(428)
we're going to have a child?	(429)
Mónica,	(430)
I love you more than my own life.	(431)
And precisely because of that great love	(432)
that I feel for you,	(433)
I'm willing to...	(434)
let you be free	(435)
to find someone else	(436)
to help you make your dreams come true.	(437)
Say something.	(438)
What do you want me to say?	(439)
I'm surprised.	(440)
I never imagined	(441)
that was how you'd show love.	(442)
I do love you.	(443)
I love you, never doubt that.	(444)
That's why I'm giving you freedom.	(445)
It's an act of love.	(446)
You have no idea how much it hurts me	(447)
to make this sacrifice.	(448)
Well, thanks. That's so nice of you.	(449)
I would have preferred	(450)
another kind of sacrifice.	(451)
Like what? What do you want me to do?	(452)
Do I have to tell you?	(453)
If you love me so much,	(454)
sacrifice yourself and have a child.	(455)
But, see, I explained to you	(456)
why I don't...	(457)
Okay, stop. Okay, I get it. Stop it.	(458)
Thank you for giving me my freedom.	(459)
Mónica.	(460)
Mónica, wait, let's keep talking.	(461)
Mónica!	(462)
I'll just take this for now.	(463)
I'll get the rest later.	(464)
Don't go, please.	(465)
Mónica, I don't know why I said that.	(466)
Really, I love you.	(467)
I love you so much, I need you.	(468)
You said it.	(469)
And you hurt me in the depths of my soul.	(470)
Mónica, please forgive me, I'm sorry...	(471)
I don't want to be here anymore.	(472)
No, I can't live without you.	(473)
Well, you'll have to learn how.	(474)
Hey, don't go, please.	(475)
Let me go.	(476)
It's too late to change your mind.	(477)
No, please.	(478)
No.	(479)
Horacio.	(480)
Are you pregnant?	(481)
Are you pregnant?	(482)
Jimmy!	(483)
Jimmy!	(484)
Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!	(485)
Jimmy!	(486)
