Why are you dressed like that?	(1)
Were you at a first communion or what?	(2)
No, I was on the date	(3)
you didn't want to go on.	(4)
What crazy lady did you meet this time?	(5)
She's not crazy, okay?	(6)
Andrea is polite, courteous...	(7)
I'm not saying this just because I met her,	(8)
but because I know her family.	(9)
Really?	(10)
Uhhuh.	(11)
How?	(12)
I have something to confess.	(13)
I ran into Samuel and Gabriela a few days ago.	(14)
 	(15)
She's the sister of the mom of that kid, Nico.	(16)
Exactly, that's her.	(17)
As it turns out, they were chatting	(18)
and saying that their mom	(19)
had just gotten divorced	(20)
and that she's looking for a new partner.	(21)
So, the woman... What's...?	(22)
Andrea.	(23)
Andrea.	(24)
Andrea is Gabriela's mom.	(25)
Exactly.	(26)
So, I thought... I immediately realized	(27)
that beautiful,	(28)
delicate, elegant woman,	(29)
well, she could be Mr. Nelson's.	(30)
And they liked the idea.	(31)
So, well, we started texting her...	(32)
What?	(33)
Yes, in your name.	(34)
You used my identity	(35)
without my permission?	(36)
You've breached my trust, Agustín!	(37)
I could... I could sue you.	(38)
No, wait. Calm down.	(39)
Don't get like that. Relax.	(40)
I did it for you, okay?	(41)
Now that I've met her in person,	(42)
well, I'm even more sure.	(43)
I'm so sure that I can say	(44)
she's the perfect woman for you.	(45)
How can you be so sure?	(46)
She's beautiful,	(47)
distinguished, courteous.	(48)
And she's very sweet, kind and...	(49)
And, well, she's no gold digger.	(50)
Money's the least of her worries.	(51)
She's a romantic.	(52)
She loves the texts I send her.	(53)
<i>We </i>send her, to be exact,	(54)
because you're using my name.	(55)
Yes, correct.	(56)
The ones we send her.	(57)
So, what do you say? Are you in?	(58)
Well, what's the next step?	(59)
She thinks you're Nelson.	(60)
No, this morning I told her	(61)
I'm your assistant	(62)
and that you asked me to apologize	(63)
because you couldn't make your date.	(64)
I bought her some flowers.	(65)
By the way, you owe me 250 pesos.	(66)
Hey, wait a second.	(67)
This was your idea.	(68)
Yes, but you had to give her	(69)
a little something.	(70)
I also said you'd treat her	(71)
to breakfast.	(72)
I have to pay for her breakfast too?	(73)
Who do you think you are, Agustín?	(74)
No, wait. Listen.	(75)
Let me prove I'm a good guy.	(76)
I'm on your side.	(77)
I'll pay for the flowers.	(78)
She didn't want breakfast anyway.	(79)
I told you she's no gold digger.	(80)
What do you say? Are you in?	(81)
Well...	(82)
Now I'm curious.	(83)
I must confess, I'm really out of shape	(84)
when it comes to love, so...	(85)
Where do I start? What do I do?	(86)
Look, first, let's text her	(87)
to invite her out	(88)
to make up for you missing your date today.	(89)
Look, I'll write it	(90)
and you take note, okay?	(91)
Distinguished and beautiful lady...	(92)
How does that sound?	(93)
Sounds good.	(94)
I'll send it so you can take a look.	(95)
Okay, perfect, yes.	(96)
Can we talk?	(97)
Excuse me.	(98)
Yes.	(99)
Have you had lunch?	(100)
No, I was going to go to	(101)
La Fonda de Doña Carolina.	(102)
Want to go together?	(103)
I haven't eaten either and, well,	(104)
we could talk.	(105)
Let's go.	(106)
Anything else?	(107)
I don't like seeing you sad.	(108)
And I know it's because	(109)
you want to have a baby.	(110)
Honey, I already explained	(111)
why I don't want to have one.	(112)
I understand you want to be a mom,	(113)
and it hurts me to not give that to you,	(114)
but my time to do that has passed.	(115)
What I want is to enjoy what's left	(116)
of my life by your side, honey.	(117)
Before you wanted to get pregnant,	(118)
we were doing great.	(119)
This isn't something I suddenly wanted.	(120)
I've always wanted to be a mom.	(121)
It's precisely because I love you	(122)
and because we're finally together	(123)
that I thought my dream could come true.	(124)
I know.	(125)
But it's a dream that's come too late.	(126)
Fine, I understand your position.	(127)
Excuse me.	(128)
What do you want to talk about?	(129)
Since we got married,	(130)
I know I haven't been doing things right.	(131)
I haven't treated you	(132)
 like you deserve,	(133)
and I've been thinking a lot.	(134)
I want you to know that, starting now,	(135)
I'm changing my attitude.	(136)
I want to be here for you	(137)
and the baby that's on the way.	(138)
I want to do everything in my power so our life will be	(139)
lived like a real family.	(140)
Pedro, are you sure	(141)
about what you're saying?	(142)
Of course.	(143)
I don't want to get my hopes up for no reason.	(144)
It would be hard for me	(145)
to lose you again.	(146)
That won't happen, Gina.	(147)
Give me another chance, please.	(148)
Fine.	(149)
Look, I just want	(150)
the best for our baby.	(151)
Let's start over with a clean slate?	(152)
Start over with a clean slate.	(153)
Thank you.	(154)
How does it look, doctor?	(155)
I've improved, right?	(156)
Unfortunately, no.	(157)
Don't say that.	(158)
Things are practically the same	(159)
as the first time I saw you.	(160)
And that's a sign	(161)
that you aren't following my indications.	(162)
What do you want from me, doctor?	(163)
I've cheated a little.	(164)
It's not easy to follow	(165)
such a strict diet the first time around.	(166)
I've also been under	(167)
a lot of stress and...	(168)
And that also makes it hard, you know?	(169)
Look, I get it.	(170)
But if you don't follow	(171)
my indications to the T,	(172)
you run the risk of dying.	(173)
Your condition requires care	(174)
and strict discipline.	(175)
Okay, doctor, I'll make an effort.	(176)
Did you go to the psychologist?	(177)
Yes, but I've been so busy with work	(178)
that I haven't been able to go again.	(179)
What he told me the first time	(180)
is more than enough	(181)
to understand my condition.	(182)
This isn't a game.	(183)
Either you follow my instructions	(184)
or you could have a serious problem.	(185)
Keeping your diabetes under control	(186)
depends only on you.	(187)
I can't do anything else.	(188)
I'll see you again in a month.	(189)
I hope that, by then,	(190)
your blood test results	(191)
will be very different, okay?	(192)
Yes, doctor.	(193)
Go see the nutritionist.	(194)
Andrea just got back to me.	(195)
She said she'd love	(196)
to have dinner with you.	(197)
Where did you say I'd take her?	(198)
I don't know...	(199)
How about Las Tortas del Finito?	(200)
No way, man. Mr. Generous, as always.	(201)
Las Tortas del Finito, seriously?	(202)
You'll scare her off.	(203)
Dazzle her with a nice restaurant.	(204)
You won't even invest in your first date.	(205)
Spend a little.	(206)
After that, well, you can take things down a notch.	(207)
Listen...	(208)
I know.	(209)
Huh?	(210)
What about Pierangelo?	(211)
What...?	(212)
Okay, fine.	(213)
That works.	(214)
I'll text her.	(215)
There it is.	(216)
Let's see, Andrea. Here she is.	(217)
My heart...	(218)
...beats uncontrollably	(219)
after reading your kind response.	(220)
How about we meet at Pierangelo tomorrow	(221)
at eight o'clock?	(222)
Perfect.	(223)
I love that restaurant.	(224)
See you there.	(225)
She says "Perfect."	(226)
This is a done deal.	(227)
How can it be, seeing that you write like you do,	(228)
that the woman you're crazy about	(229)
won't give you the time of day?	(230)
Don't go there, okay?	(231)
That love story is impossible.	(232)
Where were we? Let's see...	(233)
You need to say nice things to Andrea.	(234)
Things that... that get to her, like,	(235)
that come from the heart.	(236)
Imagine I'm her 	(237)
and we're at a restaurant.	(238)
What would you say to me?	(239)
This is hard.	(240)
Why?	(241)
Because you're ugly with a capital "u."	(242)
I'm not ugly,	(243)
I'm just wrapped in ugly packing.	(244)
Focus on your situation.	(245)
That too.	(246)
Think. If it helps, don't look at me.	(247)
Yes, that'd be better.	(248)
Let's see.	(249)
What would you say to her?	(250)
Andrea, your eyes are really beautiful.	(251)
Are they yours?	(252)
We're in trouble.	(253)
Close your eyes.	(254)
Take a deep breath.	(255)
Imagine you're with Andrea.	(256)
Let's see.	(257)
Watching the sun set on the beach.	(258)
They rays are sinking below the horizon.	(259)
They're reflecting off her golden hair.	(260)
Andrea,	(261)
I feel like I'm drowning in your depths...	(262)
Hello.	(263)
Come in.	(264)
Thank you.	(265)
I've come to apologise.	(266)
I wasn't very nice to you this morning.	(267)
Don't worry, I only came to say hello	(268)
and bring you some sweet treats.	(269)
But come through.	(270)
Would you like a coffee, a tea?	(271)
Thank you, no.	(272)
You were speaking to Pedro, weren't you?	(273)
Yes, why?	(274)
Thanks to what you said to him,	(275)
Pedro changed his mind.	(276)
He's willing do to whatever it takes	(277)
for us to have a proper family.	(278)
That's great.	(279)
You have no idea how happy I am.	(280)
Pedro is everything to me.	(281)
And he promised me	(282)
he's going to focus on us,	(283)
me and our baby.	(284)
	(285)
Hopefully that means	(286)
he'll forget about Elena.	(287)
Since that woman appeared,	(288)
he's only suffered, 	(289)
don't you think?	(290)
Don't you have anything else to say?	(291)
What do you want me to say?	(292)
I'm sorry,	(293)
I don't know what you want to hear.	(294)
At least that you're happy for us.	(295)
Of course I'm happy for you.	(296)
But Will you have a coffee? A tea?	(297)
No, thanks.	(298)
I was just passing.	(299)
I'll let you get on.	(300)
	(301)
Take care.	(302)
Thank you.	(303)
You too.	(304)
Pedro is never going	(305)
to be happy with her,	(306)
no matter how hard he tries.	(307)
So, aren't you going to have lunch?	(308)
I had lunch early with Gina.	(309)
You're not going out?	(310)
No, I brought lunch.	(311)
Yeah.	(312)
Will you try the car tomorrow?	(313)
I have to.	(314)
I'd love to go with you.	(315)
With the adjustments you've made,	(316)
it will run beautifully, right?	(317)
Ask Nelson if he'll let you.	(318)
It's fine by me.	(319)
No, man.	(320)
I've got so much work.	(321)
I'll probably have to stay late today.	(322)
But anyway, I'm going for lunch.	(323)
Enjoy.	(324)
How did it go with the doctor?	(325)
	(326)
What did Doctor Araiza say?	(327)
Oh, yes, the doctor.	(328)
What's up?	(329)
Am I interrupting you?	(330)
No.	(331)
Well, yes.	(332)
I'm looking at a car	(333)
and can't find the problem.	(334)
Just tell me how it went	(335)
and I won't keep you.	(336)
Good, good.	(337)
Great, better than I thought.	(338)
Great,	(339)
that makes me so happy.	(340)
Okay, I'll let you	(341)
get back to the car.	(342)
Okay.	(343)
What's up?	(344)
I can't get the car on the ramp.	(345)
It's making a weird sound.	(346)
So I'm using the pillars.	(347)
I'll speak to the engineer tomorrow.	(348)
Okay.	(349)
What time will you try the car?	(350)
As soon as I arrive.	(351)
Okay, let's go.	(352)
Jimmy, close up when you leave.	(353)
Yes boss, don't worry.	(354)
Thank you.	(355)
See you tomorrow.	(356)
I hope it goes well.	(357)
Okay, sleep well.	(358)
Thanks, you too.	(359)
Hello mum.	(360)
Hello darling.	(361)
I made quesadillas. Are you hungry?	(362)
Yes, I am!	(363)
Have a seat.	(364)
And Dad?	(365)
He's not home yet.	(366)
I spoke to him this afternoon and	(367)
he said he had a problem with a car.	(368)
I want to speak to you about Pedro.	(369)
What's up with him?	(370)
He told me that Ernesto told him,	(371)
that if he didn't marry Gina,	(372)
Elena would never see Nico again.	(373)
And he also said you were	(374)
the only one that knew.	(375)
Why didn't you say anything?	(376)
We could've done something.	(377)
There was nothing we could do.	(378)
Ernesto had it all calculated,	(379)
and if Pedro hadn't married Gina,	(380)
Elena would've lost her son.	(381)
I didn't say anything because	(382)
Pedro asked me.	(383)
There are secrets that	(384)
do more damage if they're kept.	(385)
You're not thinking of telling Elena.	(386)
I don't know.	(387)
At this point,	(388)
her knowing isn't going to solve anything.	(389)
It would only destroy Gina's life.	(390)
She's not my favourite person,	(391)
but I don't want to hurt her.	(392)
Hey, Gina doesn't know all this, right?	(393)
Why did she agree to marry Pedro	(394)
so suddenly, knowing he loves Elena?	(395)
That would mean Gina and Ernesto	(396)
are in cahoots.	(397)
And I don't even know if	(398)
they know each other.	(399)
You're really off piste now.	(400)
Something tells me I'm not too far off.	(401)
What something?	(402)
I don't know, just intuition.	(403)
Well it's a shame,	(404)
but that proves nothing.	(405)
My love,	(406)
I've been doing a lot of thinking about	(407)
what we were talking about.	(408)
	(409)
It really hurts me to see you so sad.	(410)
I am sad.	(411)
I want nothing more than to fix that.	(412)
I've been going	(413)
over and over it,	(414)
And I want to find a solution.	(415)
And have you?	(416)
I think so, but...	(417)
The truth is,	(418)
it's going to be a sacrifice for me.	(419)
But I think it's the only solution.	(420)
Your desire to be a mother is what's	(421)
most important at the moment, right?	(422)
I have no doubt you'd be a wonderful mother.	(423)
I can imagine all the love	(424)
you'd give a baby.	(425)
So I have to stop being selfish and	(426)
only think of you.	(427)
Are you trying to say	(428)
we're going to have a baby?	(429)
Monica,	(430)
I love you more than life itself.	(431)
And it's because of the love	(432)
I have for you	(433)
that I'm willing to...	(434)
set you free,	(435)
so you can find someone	(436)
to make your dream come true with.	(437)
Say something.	(438)
What do you want me to say?	(439)
You've taken me by surprise.	(440)
I never thought that would be	(441)
your way of loving me.	(442)
I love you.	(443)
I love you. Never doubt that.	(444)
That's why I'm giving you your freedom.	(445)
It's an act of love.	(446)
You have no idea	(447)
how painful it is.	(448)
Well thank you, how kind.	(449)
I would prefer a different	(450)
kind of sacrifice.	(451)
What? What do you want me to do?	(452)
Do I really have to tell you?	(453)
If you love me, make the sacrifice	(454)
and let's have a child.	(455)
But I already explained why I	(456)
	(457)
That's it. I get it. Enough.	(458)
Thank you for my freedom.	(459)
Monica.	(460)
Monica, wait, let's talk some more.	(461)
Monica!	(462)
I'm only going to take this for now.	(463)
I'll come for the rest.	(464)
Don't go, please.	(465)
Monica, I don't know why I said that.	(466)
I love you.	(467)
I love you so much. I need you.	(468)
You said it,	(469)
and it cut me deep.	(470)
Monica, forgive me, I'm sorry.	(471)
I don't want to stay here.	(472)
I can't live without you.	(473)
Well you'll have to learn.	(474)
Don't go, please.	(475)
Let me pass.	(476)
It's too late now.	(477)
No, please.	(478)
No, no.	(479)
Horacio.	(480)
You're pregnant?	(481)
You're pregnant?	(482)
Jimmy!	(483)
Jimmy!	(484)
Jimmy, Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!	(485)
Jimmy!	(486)
