What are you doing dressed like that?		(1)
Are you coming from a First Communion or what?		(2)
No, no, I just came from the date		(3)
you didn't want to go to.		(4)
What kind of crazy did you find now?		(5)
No crazy, huh?		(6)
Mrs. Andrea is very polite, she is very fine,		(7)
and I'm not only saying it because I met her this morning,		(8)
but because I know whose family she's from.		(9)
Oh, yeah?		(10)
Uh-huh.		(11)
How's that?		(12)
I have to tell you the truth.		(13)
A few days ago, I met Samuel and Gabriela.		(14)
You do know who I mean, don't you?		(15)
Uh, that's the kid's mom's sister, from Nico.		(16)
That's right, that one, that mere.		(17)
Well, it turns out they were there talking		(18)
and they were saying that		(19)
their mom had just divorced,		(20)
and that she'd like to have a new partner.		(21)
So the lady… how did you…?		(22)
Andrea.		(23)
Andrea.		(24)
Andrea is Gabriela's mom.		(25)
Exactly.		(26)
So, it occurred to me, I immediately thought,		(27)
this lady, then, so beautiful,		(28)
so delicate and elegant,		(29)
well, it has to be for Don Nelson.		(30)
And, well, they thought it was a good idea too.		(31)
So, we started sending him messages…		(32)
How, how, how, how?		(33)
Yes, yes, in his name.		(34)
You used my identity		(35)
without my permission?		(36)
That's an abuse of trust, Augustine!		(37)
And I… and I can… I can charge you.		(38)
No, no, wait, easy, easy.		(39)
Don't put yourself in that plan, relax.		(40)
I did it for your sake, huh?		(41)
And now that I've met her in person,		(42)
it gives me… it gives me more security.		(43)
It gives me a certainty so I can say		(44)
that she's the perfect woman for you.		(45)
Why are you so sure?		(46)
She's beautiful,		(47)
she's distinguished, she's fine.		(48)
Besides, she's very sweet, she's kind and…		(49)
And, well, nothing to take advantage of,		(50)
the money for her, man, is the least of it.		(51)
She's a romantic woman.		(52)
He loves the messages I send him.		(53)
We sent him, to be more precise,		(54)
because you're using my name.		(55)
Yeah, right, we send him,		(56)
we send him, we send him.		(57)
So what? Do you want to come in?		(58)
Well, how would we do it?		(59)
She thinks Nelson is you.		(60)
No, this morning I told you		(61)
that I was your assistant,		(62)
that you sent me to apologize because		(63)
you couldn't make it to the appointment.		(64)
I bought her a bouquet of flowers…		(65)
Oh, by the way, you owe me 250 pesos.		(66)
Hey, wait, wait, wait.		(67)
That was your idea.		(68)
Well, yeah,		(69)
but you had to get the detail.		(70)
I also told her that I had to have		(71)
some breakfast, that you invited her.		(72)
But besides, do I have to buy you breakfast?		(73)
But… but what do you think, Augustine?		(74)
No, wait, see, look.		(75)
So you see that I'm cool, huh,		(76)
that I'm in solidarity,		(77)
the flowers are on me.		(78)
And the lady didn't want any breakfast.		(79)
I'm telling you, she's not a profiteer.		(80)
What do you say? Does it fit?		(81)
Well, uh…		(82)
I'm curious.		(83)
And, I confess, I'm way out of shape		(84)
in these lovelies, so…		(85)
Where do I start? What's to be done?		(86)
Look, for the time being,		(87)
we're going to send you a little message		(88)
to invite you, in remorse that you didn't go to the appointment today.		(89)
Look, I'm writing it		(90)
for you to learn, okay?		(91)
distinguishable and beautiful lady…		(92)
You think so?		(93)
Oh, it sounds good.		(94)
I'll pass you by, so you can look at them.		(95)
Okay, perfect, yeah.		(96)
Can we talk?		(97)
Excuse me.		(98)
Yeah.		(99)
Have you eaten?		(100)
No, no, I was gonna go		(101)
to Mrs. Carolina's Fonda.		(102)
Shall we?		(103)
I haven't eaten either,		(104)
and, well, we could talk there.		(105)
Come on.		(106)
Anything else?		(107)
I don't like to see you so serious.		(108)
And I know it's about		(109)
the kid you want to have.		(110)
Honey, I already explained the reason		(111)
why I don't want to have it.		(112)
I understand your desire to be a mother,		(113)
and it really pains me not to be able to keep it to you,		(114)
but I've missed my time for that.		(115)
What I want is to enjoy what I have left		(116)
of life next to you, my love.		(117)
Before you ever thought about		(118)
getting pregnant, we were just fine.		(119)
It's not like I could think of it overnight.		(120)
I've always wanted to be a mother.		(121)
And just because I love you		(122)
and we're finally together,		(123)
I thought I could fulfill my dream.		(124)
I know.		(125)
But it's a dream that came late.		(126)
All right, I understand your position.		(127)
Excuse me.		(128)
What do you want to talk about?		(129)
Since we got married,		(130)
I know things haven't been so good.		(131)
And I haven't treated you		(132)
the way you deserve,		(133)
and I've been thinking a lot.		(134)
And I want you to know that from now on,		(135)
my attitude is going to be another.		(136)
I want to dedicate myself to you		(137)
and the baby on the way.		(138)
I want to do everything I can		(139)
to make our life a real family.		(140)
Pedro, are you sure		(141)
what you're telling me?		(142)
Of course.		(143)
I don't want to hope in vain.		(144)
It would be very difficult		(145)
for me to lose you again.		(146)
It's not gonna happen, Gina.		(147)
Give me a new chance, please.		(148)
It's okay.		(149)
Look, all I want		(150)
is what's best for our baby.		(151)
A slate and a new slate?		(152)
Clean slate.		(153)
Thank you.		(154)
How do you see them, Doctor?		(155)
I've improved, haven't I?		(156)
Unfortunately not.		(157)
But don't tell me that.		(158)
He's practically the same		(159)
as the first time I saw him.		(160)
And that's a sign that you're not		(161)
following what I told you.		(162)
What do you want, Doctor?		(163)
I've given myself my licenses.		(164)
It's not so easy to follow a diet		(165)
so strict from good to first.		(166)
Besides I've had		(167)
a lot of pressure and…		(168)
And that also counts, doesn't it?		(169)
Look, I get it.		(170)
But if you don't follow		(171)
my directions to the letter,		(172)
you risk dying.		(173)
What you have is a great deal		(174)
of care and discipline.		(175)
All right, Doctor, I'm gonna do my best.		(176)
Did you go to the psychologist?		(177)
Yeah, yeah, but with so much work,		(178)
I couldn't go to see him again.		(179)
What you said to me that time		(180)
is more than enough		(181)
to understand what's wrong with me.		(182)
This isn't a game.		(183)
Either you follow my instructions,		(184)
or you may have a very serious crisis.		(185)
Keeping your diabetes		(186)
under control depends on you.		(187)
I can't do more.		(188)
I want to see him in a month.		(189)
And I hope that, by then,		(190)
the results of your analysis		(191)
will be another, definitely, okay?		(192)
Yes, Doctor.		(193)
Go see the nutritionist.		(194)
Mrs. Andrea answered me.		(195)
He says enchanted		(196)
he's having dinner with you.		(197)
Where do I tell him to take her?		(198)
Uh, I don't know…		(199)
It could be the finite cakes.		(200)
Oh, no, man. As always, him, splendid.		(201)
Well, what do you mean, the finite cakes?		(202)
Well, he's gonna freak her out.		(203)
You beat her up with a nice restaurant.		(204)
Well, even on the first date,		(205)
I'd like to give him a little bit.		(206)
Then, then, it's coming down.		(207)
Let's see, uh…		(208)
I know.		(209)
Huh?		(210)
How's that for the pears?		(211)
How did you…		(212)
Okay, okay.		(213)
That.		(214)
I'll write to him.		(215)
There it is.		(216)
Let's see, uh, Andrea, here it is.		(217)
My heart…		(218)
"Late runaway with your kind answer.		(219)
Do you think it's okay		(220)
if we meet at the pier		(221)
tomorrow at eight o'clock?		(222)
perfect.		(223)
I love that restaurant.		(224)
I'll see you there.		(225)
He says it's perfect.		(226)
This rice is already cooked.		(227)
And how is it that, if you write those things,		(228)
the woman who brings you from a wing		(229)
doesn't give you a ticket?		(230)
Don't move that little guy, huh?		(231)
That little thing is an impossible love.		(232)
Better, to what we were, to see…		(233)
You have to say nice things to Mrs. Andrea.		(234)
Tell him things that… that come to him,		(235)
let them come out of your soul.		(236)
Imagine I'm her		(237)
and we're in a restaurant.		(238)
What would you say?		(239)
It's very difficult.		(240)
Why?		(241)
Because you're ugly with a capital EFE.		(242)
It's not that I'm ugly,		(243)
I'm ill-wrapped, it's different.		(244)
You focus on your thing.		(245)
Also, add that to him.		(246)
Think about it. If you want, don't see me.		(247)
Yeah, better, better.		(248)
Let's see.		(249)
Uh… What would I say?		(250)
Andrea, you really have pretty eyes.		(251)
Are these yours?		(252)
No, we're screwed, huh?		(253)
Let's see, close your eyes.		(254)
Here, take a deep breath.		(255)
There, imagine you're with Mrs. Andrea.		(256)
Let's see.		(257)
Watching the sun go down on the beach.		(258)
The rays that hide on the horizon		(259)
bounce off your blonde hair.		(260)
Andrea,		(261)
I feel like I'm drowning in your depth.		(262)
Hi.		(263)
Come in.		(264)
Thank you.		(265)
I'm here to apologize.		(266)
I wasn't very nice to you this morning.		(267)
Don't worry, I was just going to		(268)
say hello and bring them some sweet bread.		(269)
But come on in, don't just stand there.		(270)
You want a coffee, a cup of tea?		(271)
Thank you, no, thank you very much.		(272)
You've been talking to Pedro, haven't you?		(273)
Yeah, why?		(274)
Thanks to what you told him,		(275)
Peter decided to change his attitude.		(276)
He's willing to do everything for us		(277)
to have a family as God commands.		(278)
Oh, that's nice.		(279)
You don't know how happy I am.		(280)
Peter is everything to me.		(281)
And he promised me that he wouldn't think		(282)
of anything but us, 		(283)
my baby and me.		(284)
Uh-huh.		(285)
I hope that means		(286)
he forgets about Elena.		(287)
Ever since that woman appeared in her life,		(288)
she's been nothing but suffering for him,		(289)
don't you think?		(290)
You have nothing more to say to me than that?		(291)
What do you want me to say?		(292)
Excuse me,		(293)
but I don't know what you want to hear.		(294)
At least tell me you're happy for us.		(295)
No, no, of course I'm happy for you.		(296)
But… can I get you a coffee, a cup of tea?		(297)
No, no, really, thank you.		(298)
It was just a little pass.		(299)
I'll leave you		(300)
with everything you have to do.		(301)
Make sure it's okay.		(302)
Thank you.		(303)
You, too.		(304)
Peter, Peter's never going to be happy		(305)
with this one		(306)
even if I propose to him.		(307)
So what? Aren't you going to eat?		(308)
I ate with Gina early.		(309)
You don't go out?		(310)
No, I brought my food.		(311)
Yeah.		(312)
What, you always try the car tomorrow?		(313)
I have to.		(314)
I'd love to go with you.		(315)
With the adjustments you made to the machine,		(316)
it must have a little bit of a start, right?		(317)
Then tell Nelson to give you a chance.		(318)
I don't have a grudge, huh?		(319)
No, man, you even think.		(320)
I've had my swab loaded.		(321)
Anyway, I'm gonna stick around today to get her out.		(322)
But, well, I'm gonna have a taquito.		(323)
Bon appetit.		(324)
Dude, how'd it go with the doctor?		(325)
Huh?		(326)
That what Dr. Araiza told you.		(327)
Uh, yeah, yeah, the doctor.		(328)
What, what's wrong with you?		(329)
I interrupted you, didn't I?		(330)
No.		(331)
Well, yeah.		(332)
I'm with a car		(333)
that I don't know what it's got.		(334)
Just tell me how it went,		(335)
and I'm not interrupting you anymore.		(336)
Uh, good, good, good.		(337)
All right, better than I expected, yeah.		(338)
Oh, good, man,		(339)
you don't know how glad I am.		(340)
Well, I'll leave you,		(341)
and get on with your car, huh?		(342)
It's, it's good.		(343)
What's going on?		(344)
I can't get the car up to the ramp.		(345)
It makes a really weird noise,		(346)
and that's why I worked with the towers.		(347)
I'll talk to the technician tomorrow.		(348)
Yeah.		(349)
What time are you gonna try the car?		(350)
No, as soon as he gets here.		(351)
Well, let's go, then.		(352)
Jimmy, lock it up when you get out.		(353)
Yeah, boss, don't worry.		(354)
Thank you.		(355)
See you tomorrow.		(356)
Let it be mild.		(357)
Come on, get some rest.		(358)
Thanks, anyway.		(359)
Good night, Ma.		(360)
Good night, son.		(361)
I did sync, are you hungry?		(362)
Oh, yes, actually, yes.		(363)
Sit down.		(364)
Where's my dad?		(365)
He hasn't arrived.		(366)
In the afternoon, I talked to him, he told		(367)
me he was bringing a problem with a car.		(368)
Son, I want to talk to you, Peter.		(369)
What about him?		(370)
Well, he told me that Ernesto told her		(371)
that if she didn't marry Gina,		(372)
Elena would never see Nico again.		(373)
And he also told me that		(374)
the only one who knew it was you.		(375)
Why did you shut up?		(376)
We could have done something.		(377)
There was nothing to do, Ma.		(378)
Ernesto had it all figured out,		(379)
and if Peter hadn't married Gina,		(380)
Elena loses her son.		(381)
If I didn't say anything,		(382)
it was because Peter asked me to.		(383)
There are secrets that damage more		(384)
if you keep it than you say it.		(385)
You're not thinking about telling Elena.		(386)
I don't know, son.		(387)
At this point, even if she knows it,		(388)
she's not gonna do anything.		(389)
It's just gonna destroy Gina's life.		(390)
You know he's not a saint of my devotion,		(391)
but, well, I don't want to hurt him either.		(392)
Hey, isn't Gina aware of all this?		(393)
Now, why did you agree to marry Peter		(394)
so suddenly knowing that he loves Elena?		(395)
That would mean		(396)
that Gina and Ernesto are colluding.		(397)
And I don't even know		(398)
if you know each other, Ma.		(399)
Now you've gone but even the kitchen.		(400)
Something tells me I'm not so wrong.		(401)
Something like what?		(402)
I don't know, it's like that, pure intuition.		(403)
It's a shame, Ma,		(404)
that doesn't prove anything.		(405)
Mi amor,		(406)
I've been thinking a lot		(407)
about what we talked about.		(408)
It hurts, it hurts so much		(409)
to see you so sad.		(410)
That's how I feel.		(411)
You don't know how I want to fix it.		(412)
And I've given it a thousand laps		(413)
into the situation and…		(414)
And I want to find a way out.		(415)
Did you find her?		(416)
I think so, but…		(417)
The truth is,		(418)
it's gonna be a sacrifice to me.		(419)
But I don't see any other solution.		(420)
Your illusion of being a mother		(421)
is what matters now, isn't it?		(422)
I have no doubt you'll be a wonderful mom.		(423)
I can imagine you giving		(424)
all your love to that creature.		(425)
That's why I have to put aside		(426)
my selfishness and think only of you.		(427)
You mean		(428)
we're gonna have a kid?		(429)
Monica,		(430)
I love you more than my life.		(431)
And precisely because of that great love		(432)
		(433)
that I feel for you, I'm willing to…		(434)
let you go free,		(435)
so you can find someone		(436)
you can fulfill your wish with.		(437)
Tell me something.		(438)
What do you want me to say?		(439)
You surprise me.		(440)
I never imagined		(441)
that was the way you loved.		(442)
I do love you.		(443)
I love you, you never doubt it.		(444)
That's why I'm giving you freedom,		(445)
it's an act of love.		(446)
And you have no idea		(447)
how much it hurts to sacrifice me.		(448)
Well, thank you. That's nice.		(449)
I would have preferred		(450)
another kind of sacrifice.		(451)
Like what? What do you want me to do?		(452)
Do I have to tell you?		(453)
If you love me so much,		(454)
sacrifice yourself and have a child.		(455)
But, see, I explained to you		(456)
why I didn't…		(457)
Let's see, now. Okay, I get it. Stop it.		(458)
Thank you for giving me my freedom.		(459)
Monica.		(460)
Monica, wait, let's keep talking.		(461)
Monica!		(462)
Now I'm just gonna take this,		(463)
then I'll get the rest.		(464)
Don't go, please.		(465)
Monica, I don't know why I said that.		(466)
Really, I love you.		(467)
I love you so much, I need you.		(468)
You said it.		(469)
And it hurt deep in the heart.		(470)
Monica, please forgive me, I'm sorry…		(471)
I don't want to be here anymore.		(472)
No, I can't live without you.		(473)
Well, you'll have to learn.		(474)
Hey, don't go, please.		(475)
Let me through.		(476)
It's too late to regret it.		(477)
No, please.		(478)
No, no.		(479)
Horatio.		(480)
Are you pregnant?		(481)
Are you pregnant?		(482)
Jimmy!		(483)
Jimmy!		(484)
Jimmy, Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!		(485)
Jimmy!		(486)
